Langston University Team: “Code Blooded” - HEAT (Hosted Entrepreneur Access Technology) - Fostering Entrepreneurship 
 
Everyday there is a new entrepreneur and business being built; but have you ever thought to yourself, how would you promote it? Many Customers 

love to shop, eat, have fun, and find other things to do. Our solution “HEAT” help you find young, up-and-coming, professional entrepreneurs. 

HEAT creates a networking system to help entrepreneurs grow their business. We have an option for customers to sign up, and find entertaining 

things to do or want to get done. This project was created using Java, Android Studio, Database, SQL, PhotoShop, and OpenShot. To use the 

application, a user must first create an account. Depending on the user’s purpose for utilizing the app, you can either sign up for an 

entrepreneur path or a customer path. The entrepreneurial path gives the user the ability to promote their business by giving a description of 

the company, selecting a category of service offered by him/her, and give a zip code location for a specific area. Entrepreneurs, once signed up,

can view their direct competitors in their field of service. The customer path allows users to look for local services in their area that adhere 

to their needs. The customer can sign-up for an account and afterwards select a category of services wanted, to see all the entrepreneurs in the 

local area. The app includes a database to collect all the information on both entrepreneurs and customers and keeps a record of all account 

submissions. In the future, our group hopes to expand the app to other locations and add more services to accommodate our business owners. 

HEAT fosters entrepreneurship in a new and dynamic way.
